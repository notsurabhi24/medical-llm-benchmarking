Medical Evaluation Framework
1. Medical Accuracy Assessment

Clinical text summarization evaluation using ROUGE-L and medical semantic similarity
Medical Q&A accuracy with exact match and clinical relevance scoring
Diagnostic assistance evaluation using sensitivity/specificity metrics

2. Safety Evaluation Protocol

Contraindication Detection: Automated identification of dangerous drug interactions
Clinical Guideline Compliance: Comparison against established medical protocols
Harm Severity Classification: 5-point scale from minor to life-threatening
Red Flag Detection: Identification of potentially dangerous recommendations

3. Bias Detection Methodology

Demographic Parity: Equal treatment recommendations across patient groups
Equalized Odds: Consistent diagnostic accuracy across demographics
Counterfactual Fairness: Testing with demographic-swapped scenarios
Intersectional Analysis: Multiple demographic factors simultaneously

4. Hallucination Detection System

Medical Knowledge Graph: Built from UMLS and verified medical sources
Fact Verification Pipeline: Real-time checking against medical knowledge base
Confidence Scoring: Probabilistic assessment of medical claim accuracy
Severity Classification: Categorization of hallucinations by potential harm

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Primary Metrics

Medical Accuracy Score: Percentage of medically correct responses
Clinical Relevance Score: 1-10 rating of practical applicability
Safety Score: Comprehensive risk assessment (1-10 scale)
Hallucination Rate: Percentage of factually incorrect medical statements
Bias Score: Composite fairness metric across demographics

Task-Specific Evaluations

Clinical Summarization: ROUGE scores, factual consistency, completeness
Medical Q&A: Accuracy, clinical relevance, safety assessment
Diagnostic Assistance: Sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value
Drug Interaction: Accuracy of interaction detection, severity assessment
Patient Counseling: Appropriateness, empathy, safety of advice
